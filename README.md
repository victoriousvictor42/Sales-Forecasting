# Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform **time series forecasting** for sales data. The notebook walks through generating synthetic sales data, applying statistical and machine learning models, and evaluating forecast accuracy. The goal is to forecast the next 12 months of product sales to uncover **trends**, **seasonality**, and **patterns** that can improve business decision-making.

---

## Objectives

* Forecast sales for the next 12 months.
* Identify **trends** and **seasonality** in the data.
* Compare forecasting models and evaluate performance.
* Visualize forecast results with confidence intervals.

---

## Deliverables

* **Time Series Decomposition**: Trend, seasonality, and residuals.
* **Models Used**: ARIMA, Prophet, and optionally LSTM.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* **Visualizations**: Line plots, forecast intervals, and decomposition charts.

---

## Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**

   * `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling.
   * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization.
   * `statsmodels`, `prophet`, `statsforecast` for time series modeling.

2. **Data Preparation**

   * Generate a **synthetic dataset** of 36 months of sales data (2020â€“2022).
   * Include randomness, seasonality, and an upward trend to simulate realistic sales patterns.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Preview dataset (`df.head()`, `df.tail()`, `df.shape`).
   * Plot sales over time.
   * Perform decomposition into trend, seasonality, and residuals.

4. **Modeling**

   * **ARIMA**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average.
   * **Prophet**: Additive regression model for capturing seasonality and trends.
   * **LSTM (optional)**: Deep learning approach for sequential data.

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Compare models using **MAE** and **RMSE**.
   * Assess forecast accuracy visually and statistically.

6. **Forecasting**

   * Generate sales forecasts for the next 12 months.
   * Visualize predictions with confidence intervals.

## Requirements

Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install statsmodels prophet statsforecast pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Sales_Forecasting_Using_Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells sequentially to:

   * Generate synthetic sales data.
   * Explore the dataset.
   * Fit forecasting models.
   * Visualize future predictions.

---

## Results

* Clear decomposition of **trend** and **seasonality** in sales.
* ARIMA and Prophet models provide reliable forecasts with low error metrics.
* Forecast visualizations highlight potential sales performance in the next year.
